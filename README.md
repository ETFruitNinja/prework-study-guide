# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This prework study guide was built for myself and can be used by other students taking the bootcamp course to help us learn the course content. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and ultimately was able to see how different programming languages each play a separate role in producing a complete website.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use Ctrl+Alt+I to open Chrome DevTools for a random idea on what to study first. Then, one can read the bullet points on the website for information on the topics.

## Credits

I followed the UW Coding Bootcamp prework tutorial to construct this website.
